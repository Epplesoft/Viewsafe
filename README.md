## Purpose
This is an application for safely viewing pictures

People who must analyse pictures, sometimes must identify things they'd rather not see.

When I watch a horror movie, I squint my eyes.
This solution lets you shield your eyes from the bad things.

Opened images will be covered. You can slowly un-cover them

Folders of images can be loaded. You can click or navigate between them
