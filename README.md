## Purpose
This is an application for safely viewing pictures

People who must analyse pictures, sometimes must idenfity things they'd rather not see.
It isn't needed to fully 'see' a picture to identify its content.
When I watch a horror movie, I squint my eyes.
This program lets you squint your eyes from horror, while using your mouse and keyboard.


## Description
