## Purpose
This is an application for safely viewing pictures

People who must analyse pictures, sometimes must identify things they'd rather not see.

When I watch a horror movie, I squint my eyes.<br>This solution lets you shield your eyes from the bad things.


## Description

Opened images will be covered. <br>

Folders of images can be loaded <br>
You can navigate to look them one by one
